# Telco Churn Prediction

This project is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning".

### File descriptions

<ul>
  <li> train.csv - the training set - Contains 4250 lines with 20 columns. 3652 samples (85.93%) belong to class churn=no and 598 samples (14.07%) belong to class churn=yes </li>
  <li>test.csv - the test set - Contains 750 lines with 20 columns: the index of each sample and the 19 features (missing the target variable "churn"). </li>
</ul>

### 1. Importing and investigating the data.

After importing both the training and testing data, we check information about the train set by calling the .info() method:
